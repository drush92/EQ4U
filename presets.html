		<h1>Presets</h1>
        Those who work in the audio industry (e.g. music producers, acousticians, sound engineers) often use descriptive words to convey the quality or sonic character of a sound. Ordinarily, people use words such as ‘harsh’ or ‘bassy’ that are sometimes more subjective. However, there are descriptors used amongst audio professionals that are more or less standardised.<p>
        <b>‘Warm’</b><br>
        Warm isn’t a very specific descriptor, but a warm sound is always characterised by an abundance of lower frequencies and/or a lack of higher frequencies.<p>
		<p>
		<b>‘Bright’</b><br>
        Bright is similar to Warm. The difference is that they are the inverse of each other, with Bright characterised by an abundance of higher frequencies and/or a lack of lower frequencies.<p>
        
        <b>‘Telephone’</b><br>
        A classic sound known by everyone. We based our telephone preset on the typical narrowband frequency range of telephone transmission. High and low frequencies are omitted leaving the mid range to convey all of the audio information. Though this is reasonably effective in transmitting the human voice, it doesn’t do well with music.<p>

        <b>‘HiFi Scoop’</b><br>
        This preset aims to create a typical HiFi sound with boosted low and high frequencies. Sometimes referred to as the ‘smiley face scoop’, boosting the ends of the frequency spectrum sought to make the most of speakers that were lacking in the extremities.<p>
        
        <b>‘Presence’</b><br>
        Presence refers to the upper-middle part of the frequency range. Our presence preset mimics the boost often found in vocal microphones to lift the vocal to the perceived ‘front’ of the mix. Vocals should sound clearer when this preset is applied.<p>

        <b>‘Reduced Sharpness’</b><br>
        Sharpness relates to the proportion of high frequencies in a sound. More high frequencies result in a sharper sound which can sometimes be uncomfortable or damaging to a listener. Often, the sharpness of a sound is pinpointed around a particular frequency. This is why we suggest users experiment with the frequency control of the boosted notch filter when the sharpness preset is engaged. This way they can tailor the preset specifically to the signal.<p>
